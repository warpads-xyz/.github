WarpAds is an open display advertising protocol designed for the Farcaster ecosystem, aiming to revolutionize web3 advertising much like how Facebook Ads transformed social media marketing. By enabling users to convert any existing Farcaster frames into ad-embedded WarpAds Frames, WarpAds empowers influencers and content creators to monetize their content seamlessly. Simultaneously, it provides advertisers with a robust platform for targeted advertising—all without necessitating any changes to the original server infrastructure.

## Description

As Farcaster thrives as a leading social platform in the web3 space, the need for effective monetization and personalized advertising has become increasingly evident. Traditional advertising models often clash with the decentralized ethos of web3, leading to missed opportunities for influencers and advertisers alike. WarpAds bridges this gap by integrating advertising directly into Farcaster frames and posts, introducing a new paradigm of monetization that respects user autonomy and enhances the overall ecosystem.
